What is Gateway Adventure?



Gateway Adventure is a scavenger hunt and geocaching experience that users participate in through the "Gateway Adventure App" (GAAPP). This app combines elements of outdoor and indoor escape rooms. Users select a nearby adventure using their cell phones and follow tasks provided by the app. 



Tasks may vary and include challenges like solving puzzles, entering passkeys, or scanning multiple tags. There may also be some element of physical obstacles in order to complete the mission, depending on locations.



The Gateway Adventure App follows a storyline, introducing a mysterious organization that is looking for recruits to participate in their research and other undertakings. So the question is, do you have what it takes?
