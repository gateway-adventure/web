Gateway Adventure – Terms of Service
Last Updated: 1/29/2026
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Gateway Adventure mobile application, the website located at gatewayadventure.app, and all related services (collectively, the “Service”) operated by Gateway Adventure, a Utah company (“Gateway Adventure,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).
By accessing, creating an account, or using the Service, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.

1. Acceptance of Terms
Your use of the Service constitutes acceptance of these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Gateway Adventure regarding the Service.

2. Eligibility, Minors, and Parental Responsibility
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service.
If under 18, a parent or legal guardian must consent to your use and assumes full legal responsibility for your participation, conduct, and safety.
Parents/guardians must supervise minors at all times.
Use by minors is also governed by our Privacy Policy and applicable child data laws.

3. Nature of the Service – Technology Platform
Gateway Adventure is a technology platform that allows users to create, publish, and participate in interactive, puzzle-based adventures, including location-referenced content.
Gateway Adventure provides informational and entertainment content only. Users independently decide whether, when, and how to act on that information.
Gateway Adventure is not:
An event organizer, guide, or supervisor of real-world activity
Responsible for the safety, legality, or suitability of any location or adventure
Responsible for enforcing laws, permissions, or access restrictions

4. No Duty to Monitor / Platform Protection
Gateway Adventure has no obligation to monitor, review, screen, or approve any user-created content or adventures.
We may rely on user reports of inappropriate content but are not liable for failing to detect misuse or unsafe behavior.

5. Official Adventures vs. User-Generated Adventures
Official Adventures: Created by Gateway Adventure; may reference real-world locations. Locations are provided for informational purposes only. Participation is voluntary, and you assume all risk.
User-Generated Adventures: Created by users; Gateway Adventure does not verify, approve, or monitor these adventures.
In all cases:
Gateway Adventure does not instruct, require, or supervise users to visit any location.
You are responsible for evaluating the safety, legality, and appropriateness of any location.
Gateway Adventure does not inspect, insure, or assume responsibility for any location.
Locations and directional information may be inaccurate; verify your surroundings and do not rely solely on the Service.
All clues, instructions, timers, objectives, and game mechanics are fictional entertainment elements. Ignore any element if following it would be unsafe, illegal, or inappropriate.

6. User-Generated Adventures and Prohibited Compensation
If you create an adventure, you are solely responsible for its content, instructions, and locations. Adventures must not:
Encourage illegal activity, trespassing, or unsafe behavior
Require interaction with unwilling members of the public
Violate any law, property right, or regulation
Include private data of third parties
Users are strictly prohibited from:
Charging money or requesting donations, tips, gifts, or barter
Arranging off-platform compensation related to an adventure
By posting an adventure, you grant Gateway Adventure a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to host and display the content.

7. Real-World Activity, Hazard Warnings, and Safety
Participation may involve walking, navigation, environmental exposure, and interaction with public or private spaces.
You must:
Follow all laws, rules, and posted regulations
Stop before crossing streets, driving, or entering unsafe areas
Ensure participation is appropriate for your abilities and medical condition
Prioritize real-world safety over any gameplay mechanic, timer, or score
Maintain full situational awareness at all times
Comply immediately with law enforcement or property owner instructions
Game mechanics, timers, scoring, and competitive elements are fictional. Users must ignore any element if following it would create distraction, risk, or unsafe conditions.

8. Property, Public Nuisance, and Emergency Disclaimer
Do not place physical objects, alter environments, or damage property
Do not engage in behavior that could reasonably be perceived as suspicious, threatening, criminal, or disruptive
Gateway Adventure is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any property owner, park, city, or business

9. Navigation and Location Disclaimer
Gateway Adventure may display maps, GPS data, directional indicators, or location references. These are provided for entertainment purposes only. Users must not rely on the Service for directions, route safety, terrain conditions, legality of access, or environmental awareness.

10. In-App Purchases and Account Restrictions
Official adventures may require payment; all purchases are final.
Accounts are non-transferable. Sharing accounts or purchased content is prohibited.
Chargebacks or fraudulent disputes may result in account termination and legal action.

11. Intellectual Property
Official content is protected intellectual property.
Users may not copy, reverse engineer, create derivative works, or use official content outside the Service.

12. Media, Privacy, and User Data
Users may capture photos/videos during participation; Gateway Adventure is not responsible for media.
By posting non-private content, you grant Gateway Adventure rights to use it for promotional purposes.
Users may not include personal/private data of third parties.
Users may not imply any business, property owner, landmark, or organization is affiliated with an adventure.

13. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including safety, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

14. Release of Liability and Assumption of Risk
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you release Gateway Adventure from any claims, damages, or losses arising from:
Participation in official or user-generated adventures
Use of locations referenced in adventures
Interaction with third parties
Physical or environmental hazards
Emotional distress, anxiety, or reputational harm

Adventures you create or participate in
Injury, property damage, or disruption caused by you
Violation of these Terms or applicable law

16. Limitation of Liability
Gateway Adventure shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages.

17. Force Majeure
Gateway Adventure is not liable for delays, cancellations, or hazards resulting from natural disasters, emergencies, closures, weather, or other events beyond our control.

18. Time Limit to Bring Claims
Any claim must be brought within one (1) year of the event giving rise to the claim.

19. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Utah.

20. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
All disputes shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in Utah. You waive any right to participate in a class action or jury trial.

21. Survival
Sections relating to liability, indemnification, arbitration, intellectual property, and safety warnings survive account termination.
